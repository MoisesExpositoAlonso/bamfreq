* bamfreq
bamfreq is a small tool written in C on top of 
[[https://github.com/samtools/htslib][htslib]]. 
It iterates through a bam alignment file and reports, at each position which is
covered with at least one alignment, the total coverage and the counts of all bases
present.

Several filters may be employed, like minimum mapping quality, minimum and
maximum coverage, and minimum base frequency. These are documented in the usage
message of the tool.
