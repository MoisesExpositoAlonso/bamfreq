* bamfreq

bamfreq is a small tool written in C on top of  
[[https://github.com/samtools/htslib][htslib]]. Most code written by @clwgg, 
with only minor tweaks of @MoisesExpositoAlonso.


It iterates through a bam alignment file and reports, at each position which is
covered with at least one alignment, the total coverage and the counts of all bases
present. It outputs a file as:


Several filters may be employed, like minimum mapping quality, minimum and 
maximum coverage, and minimum base frequency. These are documented in the usage
message of the tool.

Options:
	-h	only print heterozygous positions
	-a	only print natural bases ACTG
	-f	min fraction of read support
	-q	min map quality
	-c	min coverage of position to be reported
	-m	max coverage of position to be reported
	-r	only print raw counts without bases, coverage or position

Default output:
